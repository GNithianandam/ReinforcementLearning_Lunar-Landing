# ReinforcementLearning_Lunar-Landing

The "Lunar Landing" problem from OpenAI's gym toolbox is the one we aim to solve using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The game's main objective is to efficiently lead the agent to the landing pad. While the action space is discrete, the state space is continuous, much like in real physics. In this project, the "Lunar Landing" problem will be trained onto a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent.
